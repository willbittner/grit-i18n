GRIT is the internationalization tool used by the [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/) projects (the foundation for the [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) browser) and for several internal projects at Google.

GRIT is designed to be flexible and extensible enough to use for various different types of projects, although to date it has primarily been used for client-side software projects targeting Windows, Mac and Unix platforms.

GRIT requires Python 2.6 or later.
